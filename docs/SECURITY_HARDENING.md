# Security hardening backlog

From a full review of the client surfaces and `enzoonchain/latent-server`
(2026-09), with reference to prior art in agent-ad clients. Ranked P0 → P3.
Items marked **✅ shipped** are done; the rest are the backlog, each with the
file to change.

> **Wallet auth decision:** no Lit / Vincent dependency. `LIT-Protocol/agent-wallet`
> is archived and the earnings wallet only *receives* USDC. Ownership proof for
> the sensitive endpoints is a plain EIP-191 signature (`ecrecover`). Revisit
> Vincent only if the agent ever needs to *spend* earnings.

## P0 — remaining

_None open._ The four P0s (free budget mint, signing secret, unauthenticated
payout, no `user_wallet` verification on the money path) are covered by
latent-server #90 for the payout/budget path. `user_wallet` on `/ad/request`
+ `/ad/impression` stays unauthenticated **by design** — the HMAC
`impression_token` binds `(ad_id, user_wallet)` so you can't bill an impression
for an ad you weren't served; earnings inflation is bounded by the campaign
budget debit + the daily cap. Tightening it further is P1 (session auth).

### Server

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | **Rate limiting sees the proxy IP.** `uvicorn` runs without `--proxy-headers`, so behind Railway's edge every request looks like a handful of proxy IPs → the 30/min per-IP cap throttles the *whole platform* and per-IP abuse control is meaningless. A likely cause of the constant 204s. | `Dockerfile` — `CMD uvicorn … --proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips='*'`; parse `X-Forwarded-For` in `server/routes/ads.py:_client_ip`. |
| S2 | **Open redirect / phishing.** `GET /ad/click` → `RedirectResponse(cta_url)`; `cta_url` is unvalidated at ad creation and `POST /campaign/{id}/ad` is unauthenticated. | `server/models.py` `AdCreate.cta_url` — validate `https://` scheme + block `javascript:`/`data:`; `server/routes/ads.py` — consider returning JSON instead of a 302. |
| S3 | **`/campaign/*` fully unauthenticated** — attach ads to anyone's campaign; `GET /campaign/` with no filter dumps every advertiser wallet + budget + ad copy. | `server/routes/campaigns.py` — advertiser session/API-key; `WHERE advertiser_wallet = :caller` on `{id}/ad`, `{id}/fund`, `{id}/buy`; restrict the unfiltered list. |
| S4 | **`/earnings/{wallet}[/history|/ads]` + `/payout/{wallet}` unauthenticated & enumerable**, leak prompt-derived `context`. | `server/routes/earnings.py`, `server/routes/payouts.py` — gate behind the same EIP-191 signature as `/payout/request` (`server/payout_auth.py`). |
| S5 | **Impression token replayable ~4–5×** — `IMPRESSION_REPLAY_WINDOW_SECONDS` (60s) < token TTL (300s). | `server/config.py` — set the dedup window ≥ TTL, or make tokens single-use via a `jti` set (Redis) in `server/security.py` + `server/tracker.py:log_impression`. Also honour the client's `event_uuid` (shipped in #21) for idempotent dedupe. |
| S6 | **`/ad/impression` + `/ad/click`: no rate limit, no kill-switch check; `/ad/click` has no token** and `CLICK_MULTIPLIER=50` — anyone who logged an impression can wait 2s and POST a click for 50× payout. | `server/routes/ads.py` — `check_rate_limit` + kill-switch gate on both; add `make_click_token`/`verify_click_token` (mirror the impression token) and require it on `/ad/click`. Pairs with client **C4** below. |
| S7 | **No fraud heuristics.** `safety.py` is a blocklist + a global kill bool. No per-IP impression velocity, wallet-age gating, impression:click ratio anomaly, wallet-cluster (shared IP) detection, dwell-time check. `displayed_ms` sent by the client is silently dropped. | new `server/fraud.py`; hold earnings above a threshold for review. |
| S8 | **`GET /killswitch` does not exist** (only `GET /ad/safety`, 200 even when false; toggle = env + redeploy). Client PR #20 tolerates 404. | new `server/routes/killswitch.py` → `{killed, scope, reason}` backed by a `kill_flags` DB row, toggled by `POST /admin/killswitch`; gate `/ad/impression` + `/ad/click` too. Then drop the client's 404 tolerance in `cli/src/killswitch.ts`. |
| S9 | `/health` `schema_error` raw leak (**fixed in #90** — now a generic message); `/ad/leaderboard` `limit` unclamped; `GET /campaign/{id}/status` is a public debug dump. | `server/routes/ads.py` clamp `limit`; gate `/campaign/{id}/status` behind admin/owner. |

### Client / front

| # | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | **Forgeable `/ad/click`** — OpenClaw footer + Python adapters build `GET /ad/click?ad=&w=`; no token. | `openclaw-plugin/src/lib/footer.ts`, `latent_protocol/tracker.py` — send the `click_token` from **S6**; add a client-side minimum-dwell floor (~15s of on-screen time) before a click is counted. |
| C2 | **Hermes WebUI CTA href — no scheme check.** `hermes-webui-patch.ts:_adHtml` emits `<a href="${_esc(cta_url)}">`; `_esc` escapes `&<>"` only. | `cli/src/surfaces/hermes-webui-patch.ts` — gate on an `isSafeUrl` (https-only), plain text otherwise, matching `openclaw-plugin/src/lib/footer.ts`. |
| C3 | **OpenClaw model-context injection** — `thinking-inject.ts` / `session-start.ts` put ad copy into the model prompt unfenced (Claude Code #21 fixed the hook; OpenClaw wasn't in that PR). | `openclaw-plugin/src/hooks/thinking-inject.ts`, `session-start.ts` — reuse the `fencedAdContext` pattern; better, drop ads from model context entirely (mirror the status-line-only Claude Code design). |
| C4 | **OpenClaw raw prompt leak** — `thinking-inject.ts:48` sends `event.userMessage` verbatim as `context` (Claude Code #21 fixed the status line). | classify locally, send the slug only. |

### Server

- **CORS `*`** with wildcard methods/headers → pin to the landing origin(s). `server/main.py`.
- **Container runs as root**, `COPY . .` ships `.git` + `landing/` + `cli/`. `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore` — multi-stage, `USER app`, copy only `server/` + `scripts/` + `pyproject.toml`.
- **No Alembic** — schema applied as raw multi-statement SQL at boot; a mid-file failure serves on an unverified schema. Adopt Alembic (already a dev dep); gate boot on a clean migration.
- **In-memory caches** (`safety._user_requests`, `matcher._inventory_cache`/`_daily_caps`/`_last_shown`) break on >1 replica → caps multiplied. Redis, or pin to 1 replica and document.
- **Payout tx** is legacy-type with hardcoded `gas`, a single public RPC (`mainnet.base.org`), no gas-tank pre-flight check, no shared nonce lock between the manual path and the sweep. `server/payout_engine.py` — EIP-1559, `eth_estimateGas`, RPC fallback list, ETH balance check, `asyncio.Lock`.
- **Retention** hard-deletes `ad_events` (the only fraud trail) at 90d; `impressions`/`earnings` grow unbounded. `server/retention.py` — archive instead; partition `impressions`.
- **`image_url`** — free-form advertiser string, no validation, stored as-is, returned verbatim; a naive adapter would fetch an attacker-chosen origin from every viewer. `server/models.py` `AdCreate` — require `https://` + a Latent-controlled CDN; proxy/host creative, never hot-link.
- **`MAX_IMPRESSIONS_PER_SESSION`** advertised (`/ad/safety`, `.env.example`) but never enforced — implement or drop the claim.
- **x402 `resource` arg unused** — payment requirements aren't bound to the route/campaign, so identical `amount`s produce identical challenges. `server/x402_payments.py:_build_requirements` — include `resource`.

### Client / front

- **No consent / opt-in anywhere.** `init` creates a wallet + patches every surface immediately; `enabled` defaults true. Add a first-run consent gate — CLI: `--accept-tos` or an interactive y/N in `cmdInit`; VS Code: a `showInformationMessage` (Agree / Privacy Policy) before `startDisplay`. Store the accepted ToS version, re-prompt on a bump, keep ads off until accepted. `cli/src/index.ts`, `vscode-extension/src/extension.ts`.
- **Loopback `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`** (`vscode-extension/src/loopback.ts:56`) → reflect the webview origin only; for the mutating `/impression` route require the token in a header (not just the path) + check `Origin`; rotate the token per activation.
- **CSP relaxation over-broad** — `vscode-extension/src/patcher.ts` adds `http://127.0.0.1:*` (all ports) to a signed third-party bundle, reasserted every 60s. Narrow to the exact known port, `connect-src` only; one-time consent explaining the third-party bundle is modified.
- **Extension `test/` not type-checked** — `tsconfig` `include` is `src/**` only; vitest transforms without checking. Add a test tsconfig or a `vitest --typecheck`.

---

## P3

- **Viewability model** — Latent bills on token validity, not on the ad actually being seen. Move to **cumulative visible time**: periodic on-screen heartbeats from the client, a "credited" event once a threshold (e.g. 5–15s) of visible time is reached, a stuck-session safety net, and the server authoritative on the credit. `cli/src/api.ts` — replace the single end-of-turn `displayed_ms` with heartbeats; the server reconstructs real dwell and ignores any report exceeding wall-clock since `/ad/request`.
- **Disclosure** — mostly OK (`Sponsored:` on 6/8 surfaces; #18 fixed the shimmer verb to `✦ Ad:`). Keep one standard token everywhere.
- **A minimal `/v1/*` auth layer** — the server has *no* session/consent layer. A SIWE session + `/v1/killswitch` + `/v1/consent` + `/v1/metrics` (with viewability) would enable an authenticated, consent-gated client model. Sketch, not committed.
- **Distribution integrity** — the server serves no client artifacts (CLI→npm, extension→marketplace, Python→PyPI); the surface is npm/marketplace **provenance**. The CLI publish workflow (#13) already attests provenance; do the same for the extension when it's published to Open VSX + the VS Code Marketplace.
- **Cross-platform CI** — Ubuntu only. Add `macos-latest` + `windows-latest` legs for `cli/tests/*` (the `node "C:\…"` quoting, `homedir` resolution, staged-bundle exec).
- **Install telemetry** — an opt-out anonymous beacon from `init` (`{cli_version, os, agents:[{name,version}], surfaces_patched, errors}`) so field half-installs are visible.
