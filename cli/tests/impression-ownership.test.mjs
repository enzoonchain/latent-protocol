/**
 * One displayed ad must produce exactly one billed impression.
 *
 * Claude Code runs two of our surfaces at once — the status line and the turn
 * hooks — over a shared cache file. Both used to report impressions, so a
 * single turn charged the advertiser several times over and the ad the hook
 * billed for was often never the one on screen. This test pins the rule down:
 * the status line owns the impression, the hook prefetches and stays silent,
 * and both report the same agent identifier.
 *
 * Run after `npm --prefix cli run build`:
 *   node cli/tests/impression-ownership.test.mjs
