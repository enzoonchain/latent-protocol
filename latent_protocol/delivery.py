"""Ad delivery lifecycle — reserve → render → confirm → bill.

Billing integrity rule
----------------------
``/ad/request`` only *reserves* a creative + signed token. It is **not**
billable. ``Tracker.log_impression`` (POST ``/ad/impression``) may run only
after the creative is attached to output that the host will show the human.

Fail-open for UX (agent never blocks on ads). Fail-closed for money
(no confirm → no earnings / no advertiser debit).
